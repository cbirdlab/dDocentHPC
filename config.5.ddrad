----------trimFQ: Settings for Trimming FASTQ Files---------------------------------------------------------------
146		trimmomatic MINLEN (integer, mkREF only)						Drop the read if it is below a specified length. Set to the length of the Read1 reads.
75		trimmomatic MINLEN (integer, mkBAM only)						Drop the read if it is below a specified length. Set to the minimum frag length you want mapped to the reference.
20		trimmomatic LEADING:<quality> (integer, mkBAM only)				Specifies the minimum quality required to keep a base.
15		trimmomatic TRAILING:<quality> (integer, mkREF only)			Specifies the minimum quality required to keep a base.

TruSeq3-PE-2.fa	trimmomatic ILLUMINACLIP:<fasta> (0, fasta file name)			Specifies the trimmomatic adapter file to use. entering a 0 (zero) will turn off adapter trimming. Options are: TruSeq3-PE-2.fa, TruSeq3-PE.fa, TruSeq3-SE.fa, TruSeq2-PE.fa, TruSeq2-SE.fa, any other files included with trimmomatic.  Entering a custom path here will break the script. If you want a customized file, you have to put it where the default trimmomatic files are located on your computer.  If you have trouble finding this location, run dDocentHPC trimREF and it will be included in the output.
